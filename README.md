META-PELUX-INTEL-BSP
====================
Yocto layer adding configurations required by the Pelux intel reference.

Maintained at https://github.com/pelagicore/meta-pelux

Branching
---------
This repository will follow the yocto release system. Whenever a new yocto
release has been released, a new branch with the same name will be created from
the master branch. All feature growth should happen first on the master branch,
but will also be cherry picked back to the latest yocto release branch. Security
and bug fixes will be evaluated case by case and backported as necessary.  The
ambition is to actively maintain the four latest releases and/or two year old
releases in this
fashion.
